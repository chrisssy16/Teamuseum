<h1>INSIGHT TO THE TEA GROWING REGIONS OF SRI-LANKA</h1>
            <p>One of the reasons that Ceylon teas are regarded as some of the finest in the world is due to the unique and varying characteristics of teas such as taste, flavour, colour, strength, aroma, and appearance produced in each of the different tea growing regions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sri Lanka’s tea country is located mainly in the central highlands, although some of the tea growing areas spread as far as the coast. The reason that tea grows well here is because of the topography and the climate. The fertile soil, humidity and higher rainfall provide excellent tea growing conditions and tea plants thrive. It’s also quite a bit cooler in the highlands than the coastal areas due to its elevation.</p>

<h2> TEA PLANTATION  IN SRI-LANKA</h2>
 <p>No trip to Sri Lanka would be complete without spending a little time visiting a Sri Lankan tea plantation in the Hill Country.
           On a tea plantation visit you can learn all about tea picking and tea processing and also enjoy some fine Sri Lankan tea tasting.  It’s probably a much more exciting prospect if you’re a tea lover, but even if you’re not, the Hill Country (or Tea Country, as it’s sometimes called) is arguably the most scenic part of the island and worth a visit.

    <p>The main factory in this area is Dambatenne. It was built by Sir Thomas Lipton in 1890 and is one of the best tours you can do in the hill country.

At the factory, you will be given a tour of the factory grounds where you will be able to see the whole manufacturing process- from the collection of the tea leaves to the oxidation process, and finally the packaging- of Ceylon black tea.

    <h2>TYPES OF TEA FOUND IN TEA PLANTATIONS</h2>
    <p>Depending on where the plants grow, the flavor will be different. This is why the tea in Sri Lanka is so special. Ceylon tea, as it has been known since the 19th century, has been the base tea of choice for most tea manufacturers around the world. Sri Lankans believe that their ground water has a magical quality, not only for growing great tea plants but also for brewing it.</p>
     <br>
     There are three basic kinds of tea that can be manufactured from the Camillea Sinensis plant. All sorts of tea come from the same kind of plant, but it is the soil and weather that give each plant a different flavor.

            <TD>Black tea is the most common kind of tea. Ceylon black tea is considered the cleanest tea in the world, free of harmful pesticides or additives.<br>
             To make black tea, the leaves are hand plucked by the masterful female tea pluckers<br>
                They pick only two leaves and a bud in large quantities, which are then withered, rolled and fermented, then dried and sifted. After the sifting, the leaves are separated into different grades. The largest wiry leaves are called Orange Pekoe, followed by lots of different grades, until dust grade.<br>
                 Every grade has a different color and intensity.

              White tea is the only tea that is totally handmade. The color of white tea is subtle and light. There is less caffeine and more antioxidants than in green or black tea, making white tea one of the most healthy.<br>
