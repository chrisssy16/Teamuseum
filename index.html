      <p> At the beginning of the British Colonial Era, coffee was the main crop that was grown in Sri Lanka. When the fungal disease, coffee rust, devastated the coffee cultivation in Sri Lanka, the British had to look for alternatives. Tea is one such alternative that was tested in the island nation in the colonial era.</p>

                    </ul></li>

                      <li>1st fully euipped tea factory</li>
                    </ul></li>

                    </ul></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Sri Lankan tea soon became more and more popular in London and the rest of tea-drinking Britain, making tea production spiral upwards. The early growers obviously managed to do something smart with their branding, as almost everybody worldwide has heard of Lipton Tea!</p>
